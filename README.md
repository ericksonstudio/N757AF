# N757AF
Donald Trump's 757 Livery for FlightGear (757-200)

This livery is for the current 757-200 (Rolls Royce) aircraft model available for FlightGear.

The real-life N757AF is a Boeing 757-2J4ER, not a 757-200, but as this is the only 757 model available in FlightGear it was the closest match. The only noticable difference is the 757-2J4ER has winglets whereas the 757-200 does not.

**Installation:**

After downloading and decompressing:
- move the <code>N757AF**.png**</code> file into the <code>757-200/Models</code> directory
- move the <code>N757AF.xml</code> file into the <code>757-200/Models/Liveries</code> directory
 
Launch FlightGear using the 757-200 (Rolls Royce) model. Once in FlightGear, select the "Boeing 757-200 / Select Livery" and choose the TRUMP N757AF livery. You may now fly like a billionaire!
